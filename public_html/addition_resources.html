			<li> Additional Plex Information </li></br>

			<ul>
				<li> Where ever you get your media files from, you may add them to your Plex Media folder structure and plex will
				automatically add them to the library. Plex will do all the work of organizing them and supplying the artwork and
				metadata for you.</li>
				<li> You may wish to view this intro to Plex video as a general overview and refresher for what you have learned from 
				this website: <a href = "https://vimeo.com/98564312">Video</a></li>
				<li> If you have issues accessing your Plex Media library outside of your home network, please visit the 
				<a href = "plex.tv/network">network page</a></li>
				<li> To cast Plex to your Chromecast from your phone, open up the plex app, connect to the Chromecast by selecting
				rectangle with the 3 curved lines in one of its corners, then select your Chromecast. Now, whenever you select "Play" 
				on your device, it will play on the Chromecast (tip: make sure your TV is on and tuned to the correct input).</li>
