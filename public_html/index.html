    <h3> INTRO </h3>
    <p class = "test">
      As pay TV is becoming more and more tedious to deal with, the move away from it and 
      towards an internet-based entertainment system is becoming more and more appealing 
      to people. This guide on how cutting the cord is going to show you how to do just that.

    </p>
    <h3> Requirements </h3>
    <p class = "test"> 
      Before you get started on undertaking this project, there are a few things you will need be
      understand first. 
      <ul> 
        <li> Computer Knowledge: You will need to be familiar with using the internet browser, 
             connecting new devices to the internet, and creating accounts for new services. </li>
        <li> Less Live Viewing: Due to the nature of this setup, you will be forgoing some of the
        broadcasts you might be familiar with (unless a subscription services offers live services). </li>
      </ul>
			</p>
			<h3> ECOSYSTEM </h3>
			<p class = "test">
				Next we will need to figure out what ecosystem we will use, namely, Macintosh (Apple) based or Windows/Google based setup.
				If you regularly use an iPhone and/or a Mac computer, then we will focus on setting up your system around Apple products.
				If you use Android or Windows phones and use a PC with Windows operating system, then we will focus setting up your system
				around non-Apple products. </ br>
				For apple products, the hardware receiver we will be using is the Apple TV as it integrates seamlessly with all of your
				current products. The base of operations will be your Mac computer with Plex installed on it. For non-Apple products, we 
				will use the Chromecast as our hardware receiver as it plays well with Android, Apple, and Windows phones as well as 
				Windows based PCs.
			</p>
			<h3> PLEX SETUP </h3>
			<p class = "test">
				In this sections, I am going to be showing you how to set up Plex on your Apple computer or PC. (Click HERE to jump to the
				Apple computer setup).
				</ br>
				<h4> PC Setup </h4>
				The first thing you will need to do is create an account with Plex. This will streamline the process of getting Plex up 
				and running on your computer with the least amount of hassle. 
				</ br>
				<ol class = "main">
					<li> Go to the <a href = "http://plex.tv/users/sign_up">Plex Sign Up</a> page </li>
					<li> Enter in your email address, username (this will be visible in many locations throughout Plex's services), 
					and password </li>
					<li> Click on "Create Account" </li>
					<li> Once you have done this, you will need to access your email to confirm your account by clicking on the link
					in the email sent by Plex </li>
					<li> Log into your account once you have verified it </li>
				</ol>
				</ br>
				Next, you will need to download the server to install it on your computer. This server is an application that runs
				in the background and provides you and the people you choose access to all of the media on your computer whether
				you are at home on the road.
				<ol>
					<li> Go to <a href = "http://plex.tv/downloads">Plex Downloads</a> </li>
					<li> Click on "Computer" under the Plex Media Server option </li>
					<li> Click on "Download English" to get the English version of the server </li>
				</ol>
				</ br>
				Now that you have downloaded the server, you will need to install it.
				<ol> 
					<li> Click on the downloaded file. A window will appear </li>
					<li> Go through the install process as prompted by the software </li>
					<li> Once the install process is complete, you will need to start the server. You will do this by:</li>
					<ol type = "A">
						<li> Holding the "Windows Key" and then pressing the "S" key and search window will appear</li>
						<li> Type the words "plex" into the search bar. This will select the application that was just installed 
						on your computer</li>
						<li> Press "Enter"</li>
					</ol>
				</ol>
				Now that you have the server up and running, you will need to begin the process of preparing your account for use. 
				During this process, you will be logging into your account online and adding the locations of the media on your 
				computer so that it will be visible to the plex server.
