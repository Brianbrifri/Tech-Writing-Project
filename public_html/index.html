    <h3> INTRO </h3>
    <p class = "main">
      As pay TV is becoming more and more tedious to deal with, the move away from it and 
      towards an internet-based entertainment system is becoming more and more appealing 
      to people. This guide on how cutting the cord is going to show you how to do just that.

    </p>
    <h3> REQUIREMENTS </h3> 
    <p class = "main"> 
      Before you get started on undertaking this project, there are a few things you will need be
      understand first. 
      <ul class = "main"> 
        <li> Computer Knowledge: You will need to be familiar with using the internet browser, 
             connecting new devices to the internet, and creating accounts for new services. </li>
        <li> Less Live Viewing: Due to the nature of this setup, you will be forgoing some of the
        broadcasts you might be familiar with (unless a subscription services offers live services). </li>
      </ul>
			</p>
			<h3> ECOSYSTEM </h3>
			<p class = "main">
				Next we will need to figure out what ecosystem we will use, namely, Macintosh (Apple) based or Windows/Google based setup.
				If you regularly use an iPhone and/or a Mac computer, then we will focus on setting up your system around Apple products.
				If you use Android or Windows phones and use a PC with Windows operating system, then we will focus setting up your system
				around non-Apple products. </ br>
				For apple products, the hardware receiver we will be using is the Apple TV as it integrates seamlessly with all of your
				current products. The base of operations will be your Mac computer with Plex installed on it. For non-Apple products, we 
				will use the Chromecast as our hardware receiver as it plays well with Android, Apple, and Windows phones as well as 
				Windows based PCs.
