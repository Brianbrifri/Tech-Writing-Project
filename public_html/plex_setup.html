    <h3> PLEX SETUP </h3>
      <p class = "main"> 
				In this section, I am going to be showing you how to set up Plex on your Apple computer or PC. (Click HERE to jump to the
				Apple computer setup).
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <ol class = "main" type = "1"> 
          <li> The first thing you will need to do is create an account with Plex. This will streamline the process of getting Plex up 
          and running on your computer with the least amount of hassle</li>
         </br>

          <ol type = "A">
            <li> Go to the <a href = "http://plex.tv/users/sign_up">Plex Sign Up</a> page </li>
            <li> Enter in your email address, username (this will be visible in many locations throughout Plex's services), 
            and password </li>
            <li> Click on "Create Account" </li>
            <li> Once you have done this, you will need to access your email to confirm your account by clicking on the link
            in the email sent by Plex </li>
          </ol>

          </br>
          <li> Here we will will take a moment to make sure you you have the appropriate file structure before continuing with 
          the Plex installation</li>
          </br>

          <ol type = "A">
            <li> Open up your File Explorer, the application that you use to browse for files</li>
            <li> Browse to your "Videos" folder</li>
            <li> "Right-click" and select "New" > "Folder"</li>
            <li> Name it "Plex Media"</li>
            <li> Press "Enter"</li>
            <li> Double-click on the folder you just created</li>
            <li> Make 3 more folders titled "Movies", "TV Shows", and "Home Videos"</li>
            <li> A note on file naming and folder structure within the Plex Media Libraries</li>
            </br>

            <ul>
              <li> The format for Movies is as follows:</li> 

              <ul style = "list-style-type: circle">
                <li> Plex Media\Movie_Name (Release_Year)\[Movie_Name (Release_Year)].extension</li>
                <li> e.g. Plex Media\Mission Impossible (1996)\Mission Impossible (1996).mp4</li>
                <li> Creating the folder with the same name as the file allows you to keep you files more organized if you need to add 
                subtitle files or other information for the movie</li>
              </ul>
              </br> 
              <li> The format for TV Shows is as follows:</li>

              <ul style = "list-style-type: circle">
                <li> Plex Media\TV Shows\Show Name\Season\[Show_Name sXXeYY].extension</li>
                <li> e.g. Plex Media\TV Shows\Game of Thrones\Season 01\Game of Thrones s01e01.mp4</li>
                <li> You may also add in a folder for each episode much like you did for the movies: ...\Season 01\Game of Thrones s01e01\Game of Thrones
                s01e01.mp4</li>
              </ul>

              </br>
              <li> There is no set format for home videos. The use of sub-folders is completely up to you
            </ul>
            </br>

            <li> After you have created the 3 folders, you may close the File Explorer window if you would like</li>
          </ol>

          </br>
          <li> Next, you will need to download the server to install it on your computer. This server is an application that runs
          in the background and provides you and the people you choose access to all of the media on your computer whether
          you are at home on the road</li>

          </br>
          <ol type = "A">
            <li> Go to <a href = "http://plex.tv/downloads">Plex Downloads</a> </li> 
            <li> Click on "Computer" under the Plex Media Server option </li>
            <li> Based on your operating system (Mac or Windows), you will be shown the corresponding download page. Click on "Download" to begin
            the download (If you are given an option for a language, choose your language)
          </ol>

          </br>
          <li> Now that you have downloaded the server, you will need to install it</li></br>

          <ol type = "A"> 
            <li> If you are running Windows Operating System:</li></br>

              <ol type = "i">
                <li> The downloaded file is an installer. Double-click on the downloaded file. A window will appear </li>
                <li> Go through the install process as prompted by the software </li>
                <li> Once the install process is complete, you will need to start the server. You will do this by:</li></br>

                <ol type = "a">
                  <li> Holding the "Windows Key" and then pressing the "S" key and search window will appear</li>
                  <li> Type the words "plex" into the search bar. This will select the application that was just installed 
                  on your computer</li>
                  <li> Press "Enter"</li></br>
                </ol>

              </ol>

              <li> If you are running OS X (Apple) Operating System:</li></br>

              <ol type = "i">
                <li> The downloaded file is a .zip file. Unzip the file</li>
                <li> Drag the Plex Media Server App to the "Applications" folder</li>
                <li> Double-click the Plex Media Server app from the "Applications" folder</li></br>
              </ol>

            </ol>


          <li> Now that you have the server up and running, you will need to begin the process of preparing your account for use. 
          During this process, you will be logging into your account online and adding the locations of the media on your 
          computer so that it will be visible to the plex server</li></br>

          <ol type = "A">
            <li> Log into your account online </li></br>

            <ul>

              corner of the page the click on "Sign In" </li>
              <li> If a web page was NOT launched after pressing "Enter" from the previous step, go to the 
              <a href = "https://plex.tv">Portal Login</a> and enter the credentials that you used to sign up with. After you 
              have logged in, click on "Launch" in the top-right corner of the page.</li></br>
            </ul>

            <ol type = "i">
              <li> On left left-hand side of the web page will be a divided column with the name of your computer listed. Click 
              on the "+" icon next to your computer's name</li>
              <li> Select your library type (You will be doing this multiple times for different types of media. Start with 
              which ever one you would like)</li>
              <li> You can then name the library if you wish. When you wish to proceed, click on "Next"</li>
              <li> Here you will tell Plex where on your computer to look for your media</li></br>

              <ol type = "a">
                <li> Click on "Browse For Media Folder"</li>
                <li> Browse to the appropriate folder that you created underneath the "Plex Media" folder i.e. if you are creating
                a "Movie" library, select the folder Videos\Plex Media\Movies</li>
                <li> Once you have selected the appropriate folder, click on "ADD"</li></br>
              </ol>

            </ol>

          </ol>

          </ br>
          <li> This step is to install the Google Cast extension on your Chrome Web browser (only necessary if you are using the Chromecast/Windows setup)</li></br>

            <li> Click "Add extension" when prompted</li></br>
          </ol>
